Satellites have become an essential part of our daily lives,
from communication systems and satellite television to remote sensing
and data collection. However, a single malfunction in these multi-billiondollar
satellites leads to their decommissioning and retirement, resulting
in the loss of essential services. To address this challenge, robotic systems
are being integrated into On-Orbit Servicing missions for satellite
repair, as well as the assembly and maintenance of large space infrastructures.
While robotic systems are physically tested before deployment,
these tests are often limited in scope and cost-prohibitive. Reinforcement
Learning (RL) techniques implemented through simulation environments
can offer a cost-effective approach that accelerates training and enhances
the capabilities of these systems in complex space environments.

This repository introduces AstroArm, an innovative, open-source simulation
environment to enhance robotic system capabilties in satellite servicing
through an RL training pipeline. Currently, there are no publicly available,
free simulation environments to train robotic arms using multiple
RL methodologies for complex satellite repair tasks. AstroArm fills this
gap, incorporating RL algorithms such as the REINFORCE and Actor-
Critic Proximal Policy Optimization methods to offer cost-effective, accelerated
training for satellite servicing. We demonstrate AstroArm for a
robotic hand required to perform the complex task of removing the Science
Instrument Control and Data Handling unit from the Hubble Space
Telescope. We compare AstroArm with existing environments, highlighting
its unique capabilities for advancing AI-driven space robotics.
